            "history":"The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was the first temple built in Idaho. The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was the only temple dedicated by President George Albert Smith. The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was the first temple designed with a central spire. (The design represented a return to the use of spires, as the three previously dedicated temples featured no towers or spires.) The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was originally named the Idaho Falls Temple. The presentation of the endowment was originally delivered by live acting in the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. The east side of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple originally featured a series of three reflecting ponds that were filled with water lillies and small fish. In the 1960s, the ponds were converted to flowerbeds. In 2011, the concrete ponds were removed as part of a landscaping renovation and replaced with a waterfall feature. The design of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was inspired by a vision of an ancient Nephite temple beheld by architect John Fetzer, Sr., who had prayed for guidance. While excavating through sand for the foundation of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, workers encountered solid lava rock beneath—an ideal foundation for the basement walls.",

            "history":"The first attempt to build a temple in the Kansas City area was made by the early Saints in the 1830s when a temple site was dedicated in Independence, Missouri, in 1831. The site for a second temple was dedicated farther north in Far West, Missouri, in 1838. Those temples were never constructed, however, as the Latter-day Saints were driven out of Missouri pursuant to an extermination order issued by Governor Lilburn W. Boggs in 1838. Latter-day Saints had also settled in Kansas, but they left when Church headquarters were relocated to Nauvoo, Illinois, and then to Salt Lake City, Utah. As Church membership returned and grew in the Midwest beginning at the turn of the century, Kansas City's first stake was established in 1956. By 2008, Church membership in Kansas and Missouri had grown to 100,000 members in 21 stakes.",
