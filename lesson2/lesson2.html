            <img src="images/distillery.PNG" alt="">
            <p>All throughout Bear Creek Distillerys website is a lot of white space. This is the intended purpose. The white space allows for a more simplistic look, this also allows certain elements like a title or quote to stand out from the website.In The front page, half of the website is a picture while the other half is a quote motto that represents the company.</p>

            <p>I have personal ties to this company. This is mirasys, a VMS company that I do tech support for. They use proximety whithin their device page to show that the picture belongs with the title and the tilte belongs with the link to foward onto the specifications of the device. All devices are set in this way and it lays a clear representation as to which specs belong to which device.</p>

            <h5>repetition</h5>
            <img src="images/Seasons.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Seasons of Traverse mountain is a apartment complex in Lehi,Utah. Thier use of repetition within the floor plans page allows them to use the same type of layout for each floor plan. They do not have very many floor plans but there is enough repetition within the page to keep like floor plans together and to seperate each floor plan into its distinct group.</p>
